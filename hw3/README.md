Please make sure you have the following requirements:

Main README file:
- title of the project
- project description (what the project is about)
- description of file structure (files and their purpose)
- instructions for a "competent user" on how to reproduce the project
- creative commons license for media content

- author name
PDF Report:
- abstract, introduction, data, methodology, results, conclusions
- Tables 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
- Do not hard code tables; use xtable() to produce them
- Do not hard code values that depend on the results, use inline code instead
- Do not use pandoc on the Rmd file to generate the report; you have to use the Rscript command



**Note to Professor:**
   * My License for this is in the main homework repo so I don't have to recreate one for every homework assignemnt since I am using one repo for all my homeworks
